                    Installing the Git ESMA Baselibs
                                Apr 2020
                    --------------------------------

0) REQUIREMENTS

   - C compiler, preferably gcc 

   - Fortran compiler. Tested compilers are GNU, Intel, and PGI. 
     NAG support is under development

   - The MPI library. On a Linux desktop/laptop, Open MPI is recommended.
     Make sure mpicc, mpifort, etc is on your path. Try compiling a simple
     "Hello, world!" program with mpicc and running it; sometimes you need
     to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the runtime MPI libraries can be
     found.

     Linux Note: many Linux distributions now have Open MPI packages. 
                 However these either lack Fortran altogether or
                 use gfortran. You must have Open MPI with Fortran
                 support, and the Fortran compiler used to build MPI
                 must the Fortran compiler you will be using.

   - on Linux, make sure "bison" and "flex" are installed; on generic Unix
     platforms, make sure you have "yacc" and "lex". Also, cmake is needed
     to compile pFUnit

   - on Darwin, GNU sed is needed for ESMF Applications. This sed must be 
     visible as sed (and not, say, gsed as installed by Macports)

   - CMake of a recent vintage

   - a bit of luck :-)


1) GETTING THE SOURCES

   For checking out the software from developer.nasa.gov, first
   get a tag from someone, for example v6.0.7. Then issue the git
   command:

    git clone --recurse-submodules -b v6.0.7 https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/ESMA-Baselibs.git


2) QUICK INSTALL

   If you are feeling lucky, building is just as simple as

   % cd Baselibs/src 
   % make install
   % make verify

   The canonical system name is determined by the GNU config.guess
   script include. Type

   % ./config.guess

   to find out your system name; e.g., "i686-pc-linux-gnu". The result
   of your build will be installed under "i686-pc-linux-gnu/" in this
   case; look around.


3) CUSTOMIZING YOUR INSTALLATION

   If 2) does not work you will need to recode some of the video
   drivers in assembly language and rebuild the kernel. Just
   kidding. If the Baselib does not build out of the repository, then
   you will need to customize a few things. For example, to choose the
   ifort compiler under Linux, just enter this

   BUILD=ESSENTIALS
              Use this to only build the libraries essential for GEOS

   ESMF_COMM  which ESMF communication to use; see file esmf/INSTALL
              for details. The default is "openmpi".

   CONFIG_SETUP  
              this is to help detail what combination of compiler and
              MPI was used. If unspecified, the default is the value
              of F90

   ROOTDIR    root directory for installing the binaries; the
              installation directory will be at

              prefix = $(ROOTDIR)/$(SYSNAME)/$(CONFIG_SETUP)/$(ARCH)

              where $(ARCH) is the result of `uname -s`, e.g., Linux.

   prefix     Bypass the definition above and install at this
              directory. It is no recommended that you specify this -
              specify  ROOTDIR instead


4) SITE-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS

   If you plan on installing the baselibs on a NASA NCCS or NAS-owned
   system, you can follow these instructions for a quick and easy build.

   If you are attempting to build baselibs on a system not listed here
   and you're having problems, please contact Matthew.Thompson@nasa.gov for
   assistance and future inclusion of your site in this document.

4) USING THE BASELIBS IN GEOS-5

   You just need to set BASEDIR as

   % setenv BASEDIR $(ROOTDIR)/$(SYSNAME)/$(CONFIG_SETUP)

   where, if CONFIG_SETUP is not specified during build, it
   will be $(F90)
