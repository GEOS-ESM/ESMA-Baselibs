                  The Git ESMA Baselibs
                        Oct 2019
                  ---------------------

This git repository contains a simplified version of the "baselibs"
module first developed by Gerhard Theurich and later matained by Eugene
Mirvis, Denis Nadeau, and Matthew Thompson. The current version only
includes a minimal set of libraries needed for building GEOS-5 at
NASA/GSFC.

   - ESMF
   - NetCDF-4 (C, Fortran, and C++ interfaces)
   - UDUNITS 2
   - HDF-4
   - HDF-5
   - zlib
   - szlib
   - jpeg
   - HDF-EOS2
   - HDF-EOS5
   - NCO
   - curl
   - CDO
   - pFUnit
   - GSL
   - antlr
   - gFTL
   - nccmp
   - FLAP
   - pFlogger
   - gFTL-shared
   - fArgParse

Consult the ChangeLog of the specific version number of these pakages.

A much larger set of packages (but not including ESMF and HDFEOS) is
mantained by the OpenGrADS project at:

            http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=161773 

Packages such as HDF-5 and OPeNDAP have already been implemented
there in a structure very similar to this one and can be imported very
easily if need arises.

For installation instructions, see file INSTALL.
